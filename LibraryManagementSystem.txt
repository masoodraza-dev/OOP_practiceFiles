Class: LibraryItem
Fields: title (String), itemId (int)
Constructor: Sets both fields
Method: displayInfo() â†’ prints title and itemId

Class: Book extends LibraryItem
Extra field: author (String)
Constructor: Sets title, itemId, and author
Override displayInfo() to also print the author

Class: Magazine extends LibraryItem
Extra field: issueNumber (int)
Constructor: Sets title, itemId, and issueNumber
Override displayInfo() to also print the issueNumber

Main class: LibraryTest
Create an array of LibraryItem (size 4)
Store 2 Book objects and 2 Magazine objects
Loop through array and call displayInfo() for each item (use polymorphism)

Question: Online Learning Platform System
You're developing a system for an online learning platform. The platform has different types of users: Students, Teachers, and Admins. Each user can perform their specific action.

 Requirements :
Create a base abstract class User
Fields: name, email
Constructor to initialize
Abstract method: performAction()

Create a class Student that extends User
Field: courseEnrolled
Constructor that chains to User constructor
Override performAction() to print enrolled course and action like "Viewing lectures".

Create a class Teacher that extends User
Field: subjectTaught
Constructor chaining to User
Override performAction() to print "Uploading lectures" and subject

Create a class Admin that extends User
Field: adminLevel
Constructor
Override performAction() to print "Managing platform" with level

Create an interface called FeedbackGiver
Method: giveFeedback()
Make Student and Teacher both implement FeedbackGiver
Student gives feedback like "Loved the video lectures"
Teacher gives feedback like "Need better tools for lecture upload"

In main():
Create an array of 5 User references (2 Students, 2 Teachers, 1 Admin)
Call performAction() for each
For each User who is also a FeedbackGiver, call giveFeedback() using instanceof

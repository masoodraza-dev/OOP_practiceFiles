# Word Frequency Counter

This is a simple Java program that counts the frequency of words in a sentence entered by the user.  
The program is structured into two classes:

1. **WordCount.java**  
   - Handles taking input from the user.  
   - Implements the logic to calculate and display the frequency of each word.  

2. **Main.java**  
   - Contains the `main` method.  
   - Creates an object of the `WordsCount` class and calls the `frequency()` method.

## Project Structure

## ðŸ’» How It Works
1. The program asks the user to enter a sentence.  
2. It converts the sentence into lowercase and splits it into words.  
3. It counts how many times each word appears.  
4. It prints the count of each unique word.

## Expected outputs
Enter a sentence: Java Java is fun fun fun
Count of "java" = 2
Count of "is" = 1
Count of "fun" = 3

# Rational Number Operations

This project demonstrates arithmetic operations on rational numbers (fractions) using Object-Oriented Programming in Java.  
It includes:
- **Addition** of two rational numbers
- **Subtraction** of two rational numbers
- **Multiplication** of two rational numbers
- **Division** of two rational numbers  
Fractions are automatically simplified using the **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** method (Euclidâ€™s Algorithm).  
The program takes input from the user for both fractions and displays the result in reduced form.
